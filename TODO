DataCompare:
	- review if NLV is needed with DBMS_CRYPTO.Hash call and check if orahash is faster

DbCompare: 
	- in case comparison is done using PK () or some column (--compare) 

	- add parallelism in case multiple tables/partitions - may be implemented as fork, parallel writing of output should be resolved 

	- it there is no PK nor UK on table it could be skipped, can this be changed to all columns like in GG replication?

	- add posibility to choose dedicated mode for connection

	- remap partitions? partitions --remap [db2=][schema1.][tablename1]{PART1}:[schema2.][tablename2]{PART1,PART2}

	- change dbms_crypto.hash(utl_raw.cast_to_raw(column),3) to standard_hash(column), should give 10x improvement, (check for big varchars)
		works for varchar2, number,date,timestamp. sys_op_combined_hash works ok on simple types as well.
	

	- add HTML reports
	cat ~/campaigns/release-status.html | mail -s "$(echo -e "Release Status [Green]\nContent-Type: text/html")" to.address@company.com -v
	cat ~/campaigns/release-status.html | mail -s "Release Status [Green]" -a "Content-Type: text/html" to.address@company.com
	/usr/sbin/sendmail -t to.address@company.com <__END__
